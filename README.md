Arduino Sky Safari Mission #1 (ASSM1)

For all information about this project, go to: http://www.anerdev.net/project/assm/

IMPORTANT !

The final skech (called assm.ino) is located in the "assm" folder;
The libraries that you can found in the folder "libraries" are already configured for work with this project; you must import these libraries in your Arduino library folder (http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries for more info). Only the "GSMSHIELD_futura" library is amended; the other libraries are there for a "fast download" of all. More information on: https://github.com/anerDev/ASSM1/wiki/Libraries-setting
